    (1) store the user's wallet password (i.e. the password set by the user when creating/importing the wallet), private key, mnemonic word and Keystore;
    (2) retrieve the user's wallet password, private key, mnemonic word and Keystore;
    (3) frozen wallet;
    (4) report the loss of the wallet;
    (5) transaction rollback;

    5. The integrated DApp on Bytom Chrome Wallet includes the independent DApp owned by Chainboat and the DApp provided by the third party platform. For DApp provided by third-party platforms, Bytom Chrome Wallet only provides blockchain explorer for users to enter DApp. Users should make their own judgment and assessment before accepting services or conducting transactions on third-party DApp, and whether the services or transactions provided by such third-party DApp are at risk.
